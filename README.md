**Dependency Injecti

# About

In this course, you’ll learn about **dependency injection with Dagger 2**, including diving into the generated code to understand how Dagger works under the hood.

We’re going to build an app from the ground up, but we’ll focus mostly on how Dagger works, rather than “this is the exact architecture you should use in your app”. Different architectures fit different needs and styles, and Dagger can be a huge boon to anyone of them. Once the Dagger magic is gone, it’s much easier to make it work for you, in your own way. That’s the goal of this course.

## Topics include:


- Components/Modules

- Scopes

- Qualifiers

- Multibindings

- Component lifecycle management

- Swapping injected dependencies in Espresso tests

- Generated code exploration



When you’re done with this course, you should feel comfortable knowing where to look to figure out how Dagger is connecting your dependencies with the objects that need them. With this knowledge, you’ll be in a better spot to design your own Dagger-driven architecture.
